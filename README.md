 ## Source Data  
 
- **Data Source:** Rapido ride dataset (June–August 2024) from Kaggle.
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**  Power Query Editor (PQE) and DAX.
- **Data Visualization:**  Microsoft Power BI

## Questions of findings
  
1. At what time of day are most Rapido rides taken in Bangalore?
2. Which month recorded the highest ride charges and travel distance?
3. What is the average fare range observed across the months?
4. Which payment methods are most commonly used by commuters?
5. Are most rides short trips or long trips?
6. How long do rides inside the city usually take?
7. How much time is needed for airport or outer Bangalore trips?
8. What percentage of rides are completed versus cancelled?
9. Does the fare vary a lot between months, or does it remain steady?
10. What is the overall commuting pattern in Bangalore based on the data?

## Summary of Insights
- Most rides happen at night and mornings; afternoons are quieter.  
- July saw the highest fares and longest distances.  
- Fares stay steady around ₹530–₹570 across months.  
- Digital wallets (Paytm, GPay, QR, Amazon Pay) dominate over cash.  
- Majority are short city rides; long trips are fewer.  
- City trips take ~15–30 mins, outskirts/airport 45–60+ mins.  
- 85–90% rides complete; few get cancelled.  
- Pricing is consistent with minimal monthly changes.  
- Peak demand clusters in central, IT, and residential areas.  
- Longer rides connect to airports, IT corridors, or outskirts.  
- Overall, ride patterns are stable and predictable.  

## Constraints
- Gender-based insights are missing, and since night rides are most demanded, **women’s safety and comfort remain key concerns**.
- Cancellations lack detailed cause breakdown (driver, rider, or system issues).
- Seasonal and traffic impacts not separately captured.
