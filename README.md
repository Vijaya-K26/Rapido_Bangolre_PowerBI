ðŸš– Rapido Trip Analysis â€“ Bangalore

    This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard built using ride data from Rapido in Bangalore. The main goal is to study ride patterns, fares, payments, and travel times to find meaningful insights.

ðŸŽ¨ What I Did

  Data Cleaning & Preparation

      Used Power Query to clean raw data (removed blanks, formatted columns, converted ride duration into minutes, and many more).

    Created approximate duration buckets (15 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, etc.) for easier analysis.

 Data Modeling

    Used DAX measures to calculate averages, totals, and percentages.

    Created fields like Day_status, Approximate time, Avg. Fare, and Total Distance.

  Dashboard Design

    Added Cards & Gauge for total rides, misc. charges, and revenue.

    Built Donut charts for payment methods and ride duration.

    Designed Bar & Line charts for time-based analysis (day, month, time of day).

    Used Filled Maps to show approximate travel time by area.

    Applied a consistent color theme (Rapido branding style).

ðŸ“Š Key Insights

    Most rides happen at night (late evening demand is highest).

    July recorded the highest ride charges and travel distance.

    People use Paytm, GPay, QR, and Amazon Pay almost equally.

    Most rides are short trips (<30 minutes), while longer trips are common from outskirts/airport.

    Average fares stay steady across the month (~â‚¹540â€“560).

    Majority of rides are completed successfully, while cancellations are low.

âœ… Conclusion

    Most Rapido rides in Bangalore take less than 30 minutes inside the city.

    Airport trips usually need 1â€“2 hours.

    Evenings are the busiest time for rides.

    Fares stay almost the same across months.
