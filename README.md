Rapido Trip Analysis â€“ Bangalore

This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard built using ride data from Rapido in Bangalore. The main goal is to study ride patterns, fares, payments, and travel times to find meaningful insights.

What I Did

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Used Power Query to clean raw data (removed blanks, formatted columns, converted ride duration into minutes,and may more).

Created aprroximate duration buckets (15 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, etc.) for easier analysis.

Data Modeling

Used DAX measures to calculate averages, totals, and percentages (e.g., Creating Day_status,aprroximate time,Avg. Fare, Total Distance.).

Dashboard Design

Added cards & Gauge for total rides, misc. charges, and revenue.

Built donut charts for payment methods and ride duration.

Designed bar & line charts for time-based analysis (day, month, time of day).

Used filled maps to show approximate travel time by area.

Applied a consistent color theme (Rapido branding style).
